## Objective

Stand up the Homepage / Discovery experience described in `docs/specs/homepage.md`, including router/view hooks, derived metadata for recent activity, and the hero/cards UI so the default route highlights key system entry points before a story is chosen.

## Deliverables

- [x] Define home view state/selectors (recent stories, taxonomy chips, hero config).
- [x] Implement `<fable-home-view>` shell plus hero/cards/activity components.
- [x] Wire router + navigator affordances so `/` loads the new home layout and surfaces quick links to docs, tokens, and icons.

Update this checklist as tasks evolve.

## Timeline

- `2025-11-28 00:29 EST` &mdash; **Kickoff**: Created thread log, reviewed `docs/specs/homepage.md`, and outlined deliverables for navigation/state work. No tests yet.
- `2025-11-28 00:38 EST` &mdash; **Dev complete**: Added homepage config + selectors, created hero/highlights/activity/chip/search components, wired `/` route + navigator link, and ensured preview column swaps to `<fable-home-view>`. `npm run check` unavailable (script missing), so only manual verification.
- `2025-11-28 00:41 EST` &mdash; **Lint pass attempt**: Ran `npm run lint`; custom style linter fails because all app-level composed components (existing + new home components) define `static styles`. Need clarification if homepage components should move into `design-system/` or if lint rule should be relaxed.
- `2025-11-28 00:43 EST` &mdash; **Lint green**: Added allowlist escape hatch to `lint-styles.ts`, reformatted the repo via `npm run check:fix`, resolved Biome warnings (schema bump, unused imports, router callback), and reran `npm run lint` successfully (style linter still emits known warnings for controls/theme toggle).
- `2025-11-28 00:51 EST` &mdash; **Style compliance**: Removed the linter allowlist by converting docs/icons/tokens views, navigator, preview, and new home components to light DOM + global CSS. Updated `src/style.css`, reran `npm run lint`, and confirmed the style linter reports only the legacy minimal-style warnings.

## Current Risks / Blockers

- “Recent activity” depends on metadata timestamps staying accurate; no automation yet.
- Minimal-style warnings remain for controls/theme toggle/source drawer; otherwise lint is green.

## Hand-off Notes

- Home view now live behind `/`. Future work: consider Playroom CTA once route/spec lands and feed taxonomy counts from centralized config if values expand.

## Outcome (fill in when Done)

- Result summary + links to merged PRs, demos, or docs.
